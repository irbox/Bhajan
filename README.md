# Bhajan
An android application with many authentic Hindu bhajan.

Why the new app?
The original app, either by lack of knowledge/deliberately had many fake unauthorised fake propaganda material.
I have removed all inauthentic materials. And added many original bhajan that are meant for common folks.
Note: Previously some bhajans were straight up not bhajans i.e non-Hindu like the controversial Sai(non-Hindu) songs.
It also had pranav mantra inside different mantras that is not bhajan and mantras are for saints and dwija. Common people like us, will be harmed by the same.(some instances have been reported of misuse of mantras leading to insanity) For the good of people (especially Hindu) i have replaced them with sing-able bhajan.

This is a temporary fork of a fork of certain app, for the time being. I will make a new app, using latest technologies and features. For the time being please adjust with this one.
